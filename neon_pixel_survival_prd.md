Neon Pixel Survival is a minimalist survival game where players defend their base against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. The game combines fast-paced combat with strategic resource management and base building, featuring a unique "Divine Intervention" mechanic powered by LLM integration.

## Game Overview

### Core Concept
Players control a neon pixel character defending a central base against waves of enemies. Between waves, players use collected resources to upgrade their character abilities or construct defensive buildings. The game features progressive difficulty scaling and a unique prayer system that allows players to request divine upgrades through an AI-powered church mechanic.

### Victory Conditions
Survive as many waves as possible. The game is endless with progressively increasing difficulty. Player success is measured by:
- Total waves survived
- Final score based on enemies defeated and upgrades unlocked
- Leaderboard ranking
- Achievement unlocks

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Phase 2: Upgrade Intermission (30-60 seconds)
- Player presented with upgrade selection screen
- Choose between "Build" or "Upgrade" paths
- Spend collected resources on improvements

### Building Placement
- Grid-based placement system (20x20 pixel tiles)

## Divine Intervention System

### Church Mechanics
Once built, players can access the divine intervention feature:

**Prayer Interface:**
- Text input field for player requests
- Resource cost display (1-3 Quantum Cores depending on request complexity)
- Submit button to send prayer to LLM

**LLM Integration:**
- System sends player request + current game state to language model
- LLM responds with thematically appropriate upgrade or blessing
- Responses are parsed and implemented as temporary buffs or permanent upgrades

**Example Divine Interventions:**
- "Grant me strength" → +50% damage for next 3 waves
- "Protect my base" → Base gains temporary shield
- "Multiply my resources" → Next 10 enemy kills drop double resources
- "Send me aid" → Spawns friendly defensive angel units

**Limitations:**
- Maximum 1 prayer per wave
- Increasing resource costs for repeated similar requests
- LLM responses must be filtered for appropriate game effects
